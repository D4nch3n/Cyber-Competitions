# C3 assembly challenge

This holds the files for the C3 assembly challenge parts 1 and 2! Part 1 is to figure out the password to the password.bin file, and part 2 is to escape from the company-issued virtual machine! There's a provided manual that help get competitors acquainted with the assembly language, and a VM/interpreter (which competitors will try to break out from) that can run the provided programs! There also is a bonus flag hidden somewhere as well....


Thank you MetaCTF for allowing me to host this problem for the Wild West Hacking Fest's and UVA's CTF!
